## Description

We sometimes forget to remove charger when laptop's battery get fully charged, it simply goes unnoticed which is not good for battery life. Laptop will alert you when the battery get low to critical level but do nothing when it gets fully charged. This is the basic problem which is tried to overcome with this project.
This project is written using Python.
This programme will alert the user when the battery gets fully charged by playing an alarm tone. So that user get to know about it and removes the charger.
The programme gets terminated and alarm stops automatically when the charger is removed.
